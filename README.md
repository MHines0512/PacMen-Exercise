# PacMen-Exercise

This PacMen Exercise creates a web page that produces a new PacMan everytime the button titled, Add PacMan, is pressed. With the click of the start game button, the PacMen on screen will begin to move at random, at different speeds, and in different directions. 

How to Run: Save all files to the same folder and open index.html file in new window.

Future Improvements: I may choose to revisit this exercise to implement more control over the speed and direction of the PacMen.
